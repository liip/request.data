## Temp fix for crash on starting up the vagrant box

After it crashes, ssh-into the box and run `curl https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py | python`

Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

Exit

Do `vagrant provision` again, that should fix it. â€¦best to start with a fresh box though
