        <p><span class="item_description"><a href="http://request.opendata.ch">request.opendata.ch</a> allows anyone who wants Swiss government data to be made open to request it conveniently from the agency that holds it. If you're seeking data, just fill out the form on our homepage to get started.</p>
        <p>More details of our process:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fill out the form on our front page with details on the data you want, and what agency you're asking for it.</li>
            <li>Your request is automatically emailed to the agency.</li>
            <li>Agencies can reply to requests directly by email. Replies are posted as a comment on the request detail page, and emailed directly to you.</li>
            <li>You can can add comments to the request via the comment form, or by replying to email replies. Your comments will also be emailed to requester, agency and other commenters.</li>
            <li>The result is that communication between requester, agency and interested commenters takes place largely by email but is also archived openly on the website.</li>
            <li>When the requested data has been made open, it's marked as resolved. If the agency denies the request, it's marked as denied.</li>
