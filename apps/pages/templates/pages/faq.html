            <li>Your request is automatically emailed to the agency.</li>
            <li>Agencies can reply to requests directly by email. Replies are posted as a comment on the request detail page, and emailed directly to you.</li>
            <li>You can can add comments to the request via the comment form, or by replying to email replies. Your comments will also be emailed to requester, agency and other commenters.</li>
            <li>The result is that communication between requester, agency and interested commenters takes place largely by email but is also archived openly on the website.</li>
            <li>When the requested data has been made open, it's marked as resolved. If the agency denies the request, it's marked as denied.</li>
